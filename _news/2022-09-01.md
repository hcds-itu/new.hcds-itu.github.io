Dr. Elisa Mekler joins the HCDS group from today as Assistant Professor. We're excited to welcome her and to work with her. Elisa's work combines motivational and aesthetic processes underlying human-computer interaction, in particular in the context of games. She brings her the ERC grant Theorycraft with her, which looks at how we utilize psych theories in games research and game design, and aims to devise ways on how we can do so more productively to bridge the research-practice gap.
