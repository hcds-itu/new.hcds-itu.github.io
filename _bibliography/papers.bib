	abstract = {Benefits for all user groups is one of the most prominent motivations to provide accessible information and services on the web. Designing digital technologies in a more inclusive manner for users with sensory, motor, or cognitive impairments enhances their overall quality. In practice, work on web accessibility often relies on complying with standards. But whether standards lead to improved usability and a satisfying user experience for all user groups is controversial. The present study aims at deepening our understanding of how compliance with web accessibility standards shapes the experiences of both users with and without disabilities. In a randomised controlled experiment, 66 participants with visual impairments and 65 participants without visual impairments solved tasks on an online shop built with either low (NA) or high (AA) conformance to web accessibility standards. The results show no statistically significant effects on outcomes related to usability and user experience. However, analysis of open-ended answers suggests that participants with visual impairments reported more positive experiences, and participants without visual impairments fewer negative experiences while using the online shop conformant to web accessibility standards. We therefore recommend adopting a more differentiated perspective on what can be achieved through compliance with web accessibility standards and emphasise that conformance-based approaches should be complemented with user-centred and participatory design methods. Further, since most participants reported being experienced users and an online shop is often a familiar context, more research in other settings is required.},

New developments, including ubiquitous AI and the growing integration of technologies into our lives, make these issues ever pressing, as technologies increase their ability to influence our behaviours and values. However, in HCI understandings of autonomy and agency remain ambiguous. Both concepts are used to describe a wide range of phenomena pertaining to sense-of-control, material independence, and identity. It is unclear to what degree these understandings are compatible, and how they support the development of research programs and practical interventions. We address this by reviewing 30 years of HCI research on autonomy and agency to identify current understandings, open issues, and future directions. From this analysis, we identify ethical issues, and outline key themes to guide future work. We also articulate avenues for advancing clarity and specificity around these concepts, and for coordinating integrative work across different HCI communities.},

  abstract = {This paper is a call to action for research and discussion on data visualization education. As visualization evolves and spreads through our professional and personal lives, we need to understand how to support and empower a broad and diverse community of learners in visualization. Data Visualization is a diverse and dynamic discipline that combines knowledge from different fields, is tailored to suit diverse audiences and contexts, and frequently incorporates tacit knowledge. This complex nature leads to a series of interrelated challenges for data visualization education. Driven by a lack of consolidated knowledge, overview, and orientation for visualization education, the 21 authors of this paper-educators and researchers in data visualization-identify and describe 19 challenges informed by our collective practical experience. We organize these challenges around seven themes People, Goals & Assessment, Environment, Motivation, Methods, Materials, and Change. Across these themes, we formulate 43 research questions to address these challenges. As part of our call to action, we then conclude with 5 cross-cutting opportunities and respective action items: embrace DIVERSITY+INCLUSION, build COMMUNITIES, conduct RESEARCH, act AGILE, and relish RESPONSIBILITY. We aim to inspire researchers, educators and learners to drive visualization education forward and discuss why, how, who and where we educate, as we learn to use visualization to address challenges across many scales and many domains in a rapidly changing world: http://viseducationchallenges.github.io/.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we reflect on the educational challenges and research opportunities in running data visualization design activities in the context of large courses. With the increasing number and sizes of data visualization course, we need to better understand approaches to scaling our teaching efforts. We draw on experiences organizing and facilitating activities primarily based on one instance of a master's course given to about 130 students. We provide a detailed account of the course with particular focus on the purpose, structure, and outcome of six two-hour design activities. Based on this, we reflect on three aspects of the course: First, how the course scale led us to thoroughly plan, evaluate, and revise communication between students, teaching assistants, and lecturers. Second, how we designed learning scaffolds through the design activities, and the reflections we received from students on this matter. Finally, we reflect on the diversity of the students that followed the course, the visualization exercises we used, the projects they worked on, and when to key in on simple boring problems and data sets. Thus, our paper contributes with discussions about balancing topical diversity, scaling courses to many students, and problem-based learning.},

An up-to-date survey on the use of LHRDs for interactive data visualization seems warranted to summarize how new solutions meet the characteristics and requirements of LHRDs and take advantage of their unique benefits. In this survey, we start by defining LHRDs and outlining the consequence of LHRD environments on interactive visualizations in terms of more pixels, space, users, and devices. Then, we review related literature along the four axes of visualization, interaction, evaluation studies, and applications. With these four axes, our survey provides a unique perspective and covers a broad range of aspects being relevant when developing interactive visual data analysis solutions for LHRDs. We conclude this survey by reflecting on a number of opportunities for future research to help the community take up the still open challenges of interactive visualization on LHRDs.}

  abstract = {One sunny June afternoon in a remote castle deep in Saarland, a group of visualization researchers of many stripes — from different countries, disciplines and generations — came together to discuss  teaching and learning for empowerment in visualization. Our first order of business in Saarland was to develop a shared vision: a manifesto of sorts that would guide us towards strategies to broaden data visualization skills, make them more common and accessible, and enable this empowerment. That exercise failed. Instead of creating one common manifesto (who are we to do that, anyway?), we took a different, more personal approach. We found things we liked and things we didn’t: inspiration and counter-inspiration, we crafted individual value and commitment statements ("me-ifestos"), we shared these with each other and reflected on them. The process of writing these commitment statements was illuminating and motivating. It was a positive experience with such visceral effects that we want to share the feeling with the visualization community. And so we offer a collection of "me-ifesto" excerpts from the authors and a call to action: we invite you to craft and divulge your own me-ifesto.},

  Abstract = {&lt;h4&gt;Background&lt;/h4&gt;The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is widely used by clinical coders worldwide for clinical coding morbidity data into administrative health databases. Accordingly, hospital data quality largely depends on the coders' skills acquired during ICD training, which varies greatly across countries.&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;To characterise the current landscape of international ICD clinical coding training.&lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt;An online questionnaire was created to survey the 194 World Health Organization (WHO) member countries. Questions focused on the training provided to clinical coding professionals. The survey was distributed to potential participants who met specific criteria, and to organisations specialised in the topic, such as WHO Collaborating Centres, to be forwarded to their representatives. Responses were analysed using descriptive statistics.&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;Data from 47 respondents from 26 countries revealed disparities in all inquired topics. However, most participants reported clinical coders as the primary person assigning ICD codes. Although training was available in all countries, some did not mandate training qualifications, and those that did differed in type and duration of training, with college or university degree being most common. Clinical coding certificates most frequently entailed passing a certification exam. Most countries offered continuing training opportunities, and provided a range of support resources for clinical coders.&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Variability in clinical coder training could affect data collection worldwide, thus potentially hindering international comparability of health data.&lt;h4&gt;Implications&lt;/h4&gt;These findings could encourage countries to improve their resources and training programs available for clinical coders and will ultimately be valuable to the WHO for the standardisation of ICD training.},

However, it is well studied that administrative data-based adverse event (AE) detection methods are suboptimal due to lack of clinical information. Electronic medical records (EMR) have been widely implemented and contain detailed and comprehensive information regarding all aspects of patient care, offering a valuable complement to administrative data. Harnessing the rich clinical data in EMRs offers a unique opportunity to improve detection, identify possible risk factors of AE and enhance surveillance. However, the methodological tools for detection of AEs within EMR need to be developed and validated. The objectives of this study are to develop EMR-based AE algorithms from hospital EMR data and assess AE algorithm’s validity in Canadian EMR data.   Methods Patient EMR structured and text data from acute care hospitals in Calgary, Alberta, Canada will be linked with discharge abstract data (DAD) between 2010 and 2020 (n~1.5 million). AE algorithms development. First, a comprehensive list of AEs will be generated through a systematic literature review and expert recommendations. Second, these AEs will be mapped to EMR free texts using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies. Finally, an expert panel will assess the clinical relevance of the developed NLP algorithms. AE algorithms validation: We will test the newly developed AE algorithms on 10,000 randomly selected EMRs between 2010 to 2020 from Calgary, Alberta. Trained reviewers will review the selected 10,000 EMR charts to identify AEs that had occurred during hospitalization. Performance indicators (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, F1 score, etc.) of the developed AE algorithms will be assessed using chart review data as the reference standard.   Discussion The results of this project can be widely implemented in EMR based healthcare system to accurately and timely detect in-hospital AEs.},

  abstract={Data visualization can be powerful in enabling us to make sense of complex data. Expressive data representation – where individuals have control over the nature of the output – is hard to incorporate into existing frameworks and techniques for visualization. The power of informal, rough, expressive sketches in working out ideas is well documented. This points to an opportunity to better understand how expressivity can exist in data visualization creation. We explore the expressive potential of Data Painting through a study aimed at improving our understanding of what people need and make use of in creating novel examples of data expression. Participants use exact measures of paint for data-mapping and then explore the expressive possibilities of free-form data representation. Our intentions are to improve our understanding of expressivity in data visualization; to raise questions as to the creation and use of non-traditional data visualizations; and to suggest directions for expressivity in visualization.},

  abstract={We take the well-established use of physical scale models in architecture and identify new opportunities for using them to interactively visualize and examine multiple streams of geospatial data. Overlaying, comparing, or integrating visualizations of complementary data sets in the same physical space is often challenging given the constraints of various data types and the limited design space of possible visual encodings. Our vision of "simultaneous worlds" uses physical models as a substrate upon which visualizations of multiple data streams can be dynamically and concurrently integrated. To explore the potential of this concept, we created three design explorations that use an illuminated campus model to integrate visualizations about building energy use, climate, and movement paths on a university campus. We use a research through design approach, documenting how our interdisciplinary collaborations with domain experts, students, and architects informed our designs. Based on our observations, we characterize the benefits of models for 1) situating visualizations, 2) composing visualizations, and 3) manipulating and authoring visualizations. Our work highlights the potential of physical models to support embodied exploration of spatial and non-spatial visualizations through fluid interactions.},

The Tracker offers user-friendly graphics characterizing various aspects of the current pandemic (e.g. case count, testing, hospitalizations, and policy interventions). METHODS. Six publicly available data sources were used, and were selected based on the frequency of updates, accuracy and types of data, and data presentation. The datasets have different levels of granularity for different provinces, which limits the information that we are able to show. Additionally, some datasets have missing entries, for which the “last observation carried forward” method was used. The website was created and hosted online, with a backend server, which is updated on a daily basis. The Tracker development followed an iterative process, as new figures were added to meet the changing needs of policy-makers. RESULTS. The resulting Tracker is a dashboard that visualizes real-time data, along with policy interventions from various countries, via user-friendly graphs with a hover option that reveals detailed information. The interactive features allow the user to customize the figures by jurisdiction, country/region, and the type of data shown. Data is displayed at the national and provincial level, as well as by health regions. CONCLUSION. The COVID-19 Tracker offers real-time, detailed, and interactive visualizations that have the potential to shape crucial decision-making and inform Albertans and Canadians of the current pandemic.}

However, visualization authoring tools based on a constructive approach do not scale well to larger datasets. As construction often involves manipulating small pieces of data and visuals, it requires a significant amount of time, effort, and repetitive steps. We present ReConstructor, an authoring tool in which a visualization is constructed by instantiating its structural and functional components through four interaction elements (objects, modifiers, activators, and tools). This design preserves most of the benefits of a constructive process while avoiding scalability issues by allowing designers to propagate individual mapping steps to all the elements of a visualization. We also discuss the perceived benefits of our approach and propose avenues for future research in this area.},

  author={Walny, Jagoda and Frisson, Christian and West, Mieka and Kosminsky, Doris and Knudsen, S{\o}ren and Carpendale, Sheelagh and Willett, Wesley},
  abstract={Complex data visualization design projects often entail collaboration between people with different visualization-related skills. For example, many teams include both designers who create new visualization designs and developers who implement the resulting visualization software. We identify gaps between data characterization tools, visualization design tools, and development platforms that pose challenges for designer-developer teams working to create new data visualizations. While it is common for commercial interaction design tools to support collaboration between designers and developers, creating data visualizations poses several unique challenges that are not supported by current tools. In particular, visualization designers must characterize and build an understanding of the underlying data, then specify layouts, data encodings, and other data-driven parameters that will be robust across many different data values. In larger teams, designers must also clearly communicate these mappings and their dependencies to developers, clients, and other collaborators. We report observations and reflections from five large multidisciplinary visualization design projects and highlight six data-specific visualization challenges for design specification and handoff. These challenges include adapting to changing data, anticipating edge cases in data, understanding technical challenges, articulating data-dependent interactions, communicating data mappings, and preserving the integrity of data mappings across iterations. Based on these observations, we identify opportunities for future tools for prototyping, testing, and communicating data-driven designs, which might contribute to more successful and collaborative data visualization design.},

We designed PADE based on inquiries with healthcare data analysts tasked with understanding expenses in a healthcare system that serve about six million residents. Our goals in designing the system were to enable the analysts to collaboratively construct hypotheses, quickly generate and execute strategies, and support ad hoc discussions and Q&A sessions during meetings. We created a set of interaction techniques that let users create new visualizations and combine parts of existing ones, and illustrate these possibilities through an analysis scenario.

The ICD system, in different versions, is globally used for coding morbidity and mortality statistics, however, coding practices vary across countries. Our survey includes questions about hospital data collection systems, use of features in ICD, and training of ICD coding specialists. Variations in ICD could hinder comparability and limit generalizability of observed findings. Our preliminary results establish the current state of ICD use and training internationally, and will ultimately be valuable to the World Health Organization to further research on how to improve ICD coding, and enhance international comparisons of health data. From a visualization and visual analytics perspective, the current differences in adoption and use of ICD poses challenges and opportunities. For example, when morbidity-data from two countries differ in their coding, can we still compare data from these countries, and if so, then under which circumstances? We discuss how visualization and visual analytics might help in these situations.},

However, a visualization is only a single translation of reality, just like any other media, representation devices, or modes of representation. If we wish to encourage thoughtful, informed, and literate consumption of data visualizations, it is crucial that we consider why they are often presented and interpreted as objective. We reflect theoretically on data visualization as a system of representation historically anchored in science, rationalism, and notions of objectivity. It establishes itself within a lineage of conventions for visual representations which extends from the Renaissance to the present and includes perspective drawing, photography, cinema and television, as well as computer graphics. By examining our tendency to see credibility in data visualizations and grounding that predisposition in a historical context, we hope to encourage more critical and nuanced production and interpretation of data visualizations in the public discourse.},

  abstract={Visualization systems with multiple views are often used to represent data from different perspectives. There are many advantages in doing so, such as providing a way for users to understand a dataset by revealing its various attributes in separate views and offering additional information that could be more useful than if it was just one graph. However, this can often make data seem complicated and overwhelming as each view remains independent. We present a visualization that utilizes multiple views as a means for interaction and unifying the different data dimensions of a multi-view system. This creates a cohesive visualization that displays different aspects of the data, in this case, hierarchical text data and numerical data. With this personal data visualization, we offer a potential solution for relating additional data structures through interaction while maintaining different data types shown and linking multiple views to form a larger connected graph.},

The three cases relate to visualizing sports, construction, and cooking domain data, and use primarily time-domain data and visualizations.

To improve our understanding of how to visualize view relations, we invited visualization and interaction designers to critique and sketch representations of view relations. The participants provided design critiques, and sketched their own relation representations. Our findings expand the range and palette of ways of visually linking visualization views and suggest new directions for designing view relation representations to better support analysis with multiple views.},

We show unsurprisingly that elite soccer teenagers are able to use information visualizations to gain new information about their performance. Based on our investigation, we define a classification of the level of data comprehension. Secondly, we demonstrate a method which allows visualization researchers and practitioners to design and evaluate visualization concepts based on real data over a short time-span. Finally, we argue that designers of personal information visualizations need to consider the range of visualization literacies that are to be expected in many target populations. Our lessons provide new insights in peoples’ use of visualizations and more broadly in visualization literacy. From these insights, we discuss implications for design of visualizations that consider peoples’ level of visualization literacy.},

We report on 11 workshops with data analysts from various fields, including artistic photography, phone log analysis, astrophysics, and health care policy. Analysts were asked to walk through recent tasks using actual data on a large whiteboard, imagining it to be a large display. From the resulting comments and a video analysis of behavior in the workshops, we generate ideas for new interaction techniques for large displays. These ideas include supporting sequences of visualizations with backtracking and fluid exploration of alternatives; using distance to the display to change visualizations; and fixing variables and data sets on the display or relative to the user.},

  title={Usability analysis of tabletop systems-design properties and possibilities},
  author={Knudsen, S{\o}ren},
  year={2008},
  abstract={The traditional graphical user interface employing windows, icons, menus and pointers show weaknesses in face to face collaboration, and has done so during its lifetime. The hype of multi-touch technology marks a new and promising path for treading new lands in computer use. Tangible computing is another less hyped futuristic interaction method on the verge to mass media coverage. Discovering the differences and similarities of these two methods of interaction in face to face collaboration applications is not one possible, but needed, in order to understand, not just what to design, but how to design it.
In the works, collaboration performance of the two interaction methods is held up in the light, fir everybody to perceive and evaluate the differences. It is shown, that the two interaction methods are rather collaborators than contestants – they augment each other well, showing strengths, where the other show weaknesses.
It is described how a tabletop system, which supports both methods of interaction is designed, built and used for subsequent evaluations. The possibilities of a system, utilizing these interaction methods, in design of signal processing systems in a research group, is proposed, analyzed, and evaluated — although never fully implemented
The major conclusion stemming from this work is, that that combination of multi-touch interaction and tangible computing should be experienced, in order to fully understand their possibilities. The single-most important problem facing this conclusion is, that these interaction systems don’t exist commercially yet.},

  abstract={We describe MuZeeker, a search engine with domain knowledge based on Wikipedia. MuZeeker enables the user to refine a search in multiple steps by means of category selection. In the present version we focus on multimedia search related to music and we present two prototype search applications (web-based and mobile). A category based filtering approach enables the user to refine a search through relevance feedback by category selection instead of typing additional text, which was found to be an advantage in the mobile MuZeeker application. We report from a usability evaluation using the think aloud protocol, in which N=10 participants performed tasks using respectively MuZeeker and a customized Google search engine. The experiment gave initial indications that participants were capable of solving tasks slightly better using MuZeeker, while the "inexperienced" MuZeeker users performed slightly slower than experienced Google users. 75% of the participants reported a subjective preference for MuZeeker.},

    abstract     = {Body ownership illusions (BOIs) occur when participants experience that their actual body is replaced by a body shown in virtual reality (VR). Based on a systematic review of the cumulative evidence on BOIs from 111 research papers published in 2010 to 2021, this article summarizes the findings of empirical studies of BOIs. Following the PRISMA guidelines, the review points to diverse experimental practices for inducing and measuring body ownership. The two major components of embodiment measurement, body ownership and agency, are examined. The embodiment of virtual avatars generally leads to modest body ownership and slightly higher agency. We also find that BOI research lacks statistical power and standardization across tasks, measurement instruments, and analysis approaches. Furthermore, the reviewed studies showed a lack of clarity in fundamental terminology, constructs, and theoretical underpinnings. These issues restrict scientific advances on the major components of BOIs, and together impede scientific rigor and theory-building.},
